Hi, and welcome to a platform where I will discuss some projects that I'm working on, including (but not limited to) research in particle physics and machine learning, teaching, baby stuff, and cycling.  Thank you for coming. :::)))

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
